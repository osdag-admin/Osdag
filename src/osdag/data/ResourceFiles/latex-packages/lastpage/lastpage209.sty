%% This package was invented by Jeffrey P. Goldberg.
%% I thought that an enhancement was needed and therefore created the pageslts package,
%% https://ctan.org/pkg/pageslts. Nevertheless, for compatibility with existing
%% documents/packages as well as for the low amount of resources needed by the
%% lastpage package (no new counter!), I updated this package.
%% Thanks go to Jeffrey P. Goldberg for allowing me to do this.
%% 
%% While this package allows for things like "Page slash thepage{} of slash pageref{LastPage}"
%% to get "Page 7 of 9" or "Page VII of IX",
%% the NUMBER of pages is nowadays available from the kernel
%% (slash @abspage@last, slash thetotalpages, slash PreviousTotalPages),
%% but with pages for example I to X and then 1 to 10, the number of pages would be "20",
%% while the name of the last page is "10". Decide what you need/want!
%% 
%% This work consists of the main source file lastpage.dtx,
%% the README, and the derived files
%%    lastpage.sty, lastpage209.sty, lastpage2e.sty,
%%    lastpageclassic.sty, lastpagemodern.sty,
%%    lastpage.pdf, lastpage.ins, lastpage.drv,
%%    lastpage-example.tex, lastpage-example.pdf.
