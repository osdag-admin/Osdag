  Open Steel Design and Graphics <br><br>
  <a href="http://osdag.fossee.in/">Osdag</a><br><br>
  Osdag is a cross-platform free/libre and open-source software for the design (and detailing) of steel structures, following the Indian Standard IS 800:2007. It allows the user to design steel connections, members and systems using a graphical user interface. The interactive GUI provides a 3D visualisation of the designed component and an option to export the CAD model to any drafting software for the creation of construction/fabrication drawings. The design is typically optimised following industry best practices.
  Starting with version 2017.06.a.e2dd, the beta version of Osdag is released under the terms and conditions of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL) Version 3.

## <a id="user-content-version" class="anchor" href="#version" aria-hidden="true"></a> Versioning
The latest version of Osdag can perform design for two scenarios;

Scenario 1: Users can obtain the optimum design for a given scenario, from a suite of available options in terms of steel sections (e.g., different channel sizes and plate thicknesses) and connectors (e.g., bolts of different grades and diameters). The optimum design is selected based on the total volume of material and this design solution is detailed in the output dock and design report.

Scenario 2: Perform a design check with a specific set of single inputs/selections in the 'Customized' option. In this case, Osdag will inform if the design checks are satisfied and suggest changes otherwise. 

The Design Report has been reformatted using the LaTeX software system through the PyLaTeX package. The report is much more detailed and shows step-by-step calculation(s) for a better user experience.

The Shear and Moment connections available with the previous versions have been modified in terms of structure at the backend, GUI and calculations. Any know bug(s) have been fixed. 

The latest version of Osdag contains the following modules (in addition to the ones available with the previous versions):

    Beam-Beam Splice Connection

        Beam-Beam Cover Plate Bolted
        Beam-Beam End Plate
